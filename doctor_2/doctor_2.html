    Salary:
The starting level for the doctor career is a medical intern with a salary of §18 an hour or §144 a day (7am to 3pm). With a schedule of Friday to Tuesday, the weekly payday for this job is §720. I got promoted up the the 4th level, medical technologist and get paid §48 an hour. 

Variation: There are multiple different tasks to do like admitting a patient to a hospital bed, examining a patient on the bed by checking ears, eyes, temperature, etc, analyzing patient swabs, administering medicine, and preforming x-rays. The thing is, everything takes place in the same facility. This makes the job kind of boring, and I’m usually thankful when the work shift comes to an end. I do know that that the more you move up the latter, the more tasks you are able to preform. I do wonder if these tasks actually are that different from the current ones I’m doing.

Challenge: Honestly this job really has to do with just clicking. No matter what the task is, I just have to click on the patient, machine, computer, etc and choose the option I want to do. Then I just watch myself do it. Even though I’m supposedly figuring out the diagnosis for patients, all I’m doing is clicking on them to examine them and then clicking on the machine to analyze samples and then I figure out the diagnosis and give the medicine. I think it would be fun to be more involved in the diagnosing process by being able to guess the sickness or having to give the right medicine instead of it automatically being the right one. The only challenge I can think of is making sure all the patients waiting at the desk get admitted, but there doesn’t seem the be a penalty for not admitting any. One annoying thing I have to do is mop up these puddles that are always on the floor for some reason. I also have to remember to make the beds after patients leave, but also it doesn’t seem to matter to new patients if I never make the bed anyway.
