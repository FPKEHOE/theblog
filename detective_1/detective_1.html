    Salary:
    The starting level for the detective career is a cadet with a salary of §20 an hour or §180 a day. (9am to 6pm). With a schedule of Monday to Friday, the weekly payday for this job is §900. I was able to get promoted up to the 3rd level, a corporal, and get paid §38 an hour. 
    
    Variation:
    On my first few days working, I was able to leave the police station, which was a great change of environment. To leave the police station, I could go on patrol and look for people top fine for things like littering or fighting. I did witness a fight but I couldn’t figure out how to fine them, which would have been more fun. I could also travel by helping at a crime scene, taking witness reports and searching for and then collecting or photographing evidence. I found this exciting because the photos, evidence samples, and witness reports I collected would be available for me to analyze later in the police station instead of just being some task to complete. Once I analyze these things, I go to the investigation map I’ve created to add clues, which get added to my notebook.
    
    
    Challenge: When I have to go on duty or look for suspect, it’s pretty hard to figure out what to do at first. Once you get the hang of it it’s fun. Once I have an enough clues, which are descriptions of the suspect, I can issue an APB. That also takes me outside of the police station and then I can look for the suspect based on my clues and citizen’s descriptions to arrest the suspect. I do wish that the actual reason of the arrest is given to me to make it more interesting. After arresting the suspect, I go back to the station and can interrogate the suspect in order to get a confession. This does require me to be enough of a good cop or a bad cop, depending on the suspect, in order to lure the confession out of the suspect. Once I do get a confession, it’s pretty rewarding. Besides that, I can interact with other prisoners by taking mugshots, fingerprints, etc. Overall there is a lot of different tasks I can do that all require different things I have to do to complete them.
