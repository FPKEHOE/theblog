    Hello everyone, my name is Franny! One of my favorite memories I have from my last year in middle school, when I was in 9th grade, was playing the Sims 4 on my friend’s computer during any chance I got, even if it was a 15 minute break and it took about half of that time to boot up the game. I eventually bought the Sims 4 on my own laptop and my friend and I would play the Sims separately, yet next to each other. As I got more into the game, I started buying the expansion packs that my friend already had. One of them was Sims Get to Work, which is the topic of my review. In this blog, I will be reviewing all three of the careers available with the Get to Work expansion pack and rank them from best to worst. 
	Sims 4 Get to Work is my personal favorite expansion pack in Sim 4. Though I haven’t gotten every expansion pack out there, I do believe it offers the most bang for its buck. Without this pack, your sims can go to work but you have no way to join them and you have to wait at home for them to return. Being able to go to work is a great way to mix up your typical Sims day. This expansion pack comes with a multitude of features, some that have been added since I first bought it 6 years ago. What I will be focusing on today are the 3 main career options that were included in the pack when I was played in 9th grade: scientist, doctor, and detective. I won’t be including the retail store option because that includes some other dynamics to the game. I will also be reviewing these jobs based off the starting level of each career, as it does take some time to be promoted and each promotion comes with new features two the work. I will be reviewing these 3 careers based off the entry-level salary, the variation of the work tasks, the challenge of the job, and the work facilities. I won’t be reviewing the hours for each job because you always have the choice to not join your sim to work, but they will be included to calculate salary. I hope you enjoy my review of the interactive careers in Sims 4 and that it bring ups memories for any other simmers out there!
